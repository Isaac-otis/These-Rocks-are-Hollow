      These rocks know all of your secrets your shame your joy. They pile up
      one-by-one eroding ever-teenier until they are only more rocks– just much
      smaller. Maybe our secrets shames and joys get smaller as time goes on!

      In the desert lives a ten armed tentacled creature Who gobbles up spoiled
      boys and girls He picks his teeth with their arms And scratches his toes
      with their feet! Sometimes he isn’t good at his job And snarfs a good
      kiddie or two
